# Nature Shared References

Use this package only as a dependency of another installed Nature skill.

- Load the exact referenced file; do not preload the whole package.
- Treat `core/` and `journal-formats/` as shared definitions, not standalone workflows.
- Return to the requesting skill for task logic, output format, and final QA.
