# `nature-polishing` Skill

[中文说明](README.md)

`nature-polishing` polishes, restructures, or translates academic manuscript text into concise Nature-leaning English while preserving author meaning, evidence boundaries, and citation intent.

## What To Use It For

- Translate Chinese academic paragraphs into submission-ready English.
- Shorten long sentences and improve argument order and paragraph movement.
- Adjust abstracts, introductions, results, discussions, or titles using Nature / Nature Communications article patterns.
- Distinguish research-paper and methods-paper writing priorities.
- Check AI-like phrasing, exaggerated claims, excessive causal language, and unnatural collocations.

## Method Sources

- Writing strategy: hourglass structure, reader workflow, and section roles from academic-writing course notes.
- Published article patterns: section moves from selected Nature and Nature Communications papers.
- Phrase support: expression families from Academic Phrasebank.

## Typical Requests

- "Translate this Chinese Results paragraph into Nature-style English, keeping it conservative."
- "Polish this abstract without changing facts or citation intent."
- "This introduction sounds too AI-written; rebuild its logic and language."

## What You Need To Provide

- Source text, target section, paper type, and terms that must be preserved.
- Facts, data, citations, and specialized expressions that must not change.
- Desired output: rewritten text only, or rewritten text with change notes and risk flags.

## Outputs

- Ready-to-paste English rewrite or Chinese-English paired version.
- Key change notes: logic reordering, tone tightening, terminology alignment, and claim boundaries.
- Facts or citation intent that require author confirmation.

## Boundaries

- The skill does not add results, mechanisms, statistical significance, or citations not provided by the author.
- It does not exaggerate novelty, causality, or generality to sound more like Nature.
- For building a manuscript section from scratch, use `nature-writing` first.
